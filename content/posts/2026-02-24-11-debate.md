# 📢 오늘의 발제

Global stock markets are showing mixed movements with concerns over US trade policy and tariffs, alongside significant AI developments. Major tech players like JPMorgan are investing heavily in AI, signaling its importance. However, rapid AI tool advancements (e.g., Anthropic) are accompanied by market volatility, exemplified by IBM's stock drop and reports of 'dystopian AI' impacting payment and software stocks. This dichotomy fuels an ongoing debate about the sustainability and impact of AI in the investment landscape, with the VIX volatility index showing a recent increase and cryptocurrencies experiencing declines.

## The Relentless March of Innovation: Valuation is a Rearview Mirror

The market is awash with cautious whispers, "AI bubble," they lament, pointing to "unsustainable valuations." This is the predictable refrain of those who missed the internet revolution, the mobile computing surge, and every paradigm shift before it. True disruption doesn't arrive with a modest P/E ratio; it shatters existing metrics. What these naysayers fail to grasp is that traditional valuation models are utterly inadequate for technologies undergoing exponential growth and redefining entire sectors. We are witnessing the very genesis of a new industrial era, driven by AI's relentless advance.

JPMorgan's audacious $20 billion AI investment isn't charity; it's a strategic imperative. This isn't about incremental gains; it's about competitive survival and dominance. When institutional behemoths are forced to pivot so aggressively, it’s a clear signal: AI is no longer optional; it's foundational.

## Pure-Play Powerhouses: The Engines of Disruption

The real opportunity lies not with the laggards cautiously integrating AI, but with the pure-play innovators at the bleeding edge. These are the companies building the foundational models, developing the next-gen algorithms, and creating the infrastructure that will power every facet of the future economy. Their "high valuations" reflect not irrational exuberance, but the immense, often underestimated, total addressable market they are poised to conquer.

Dismissing these pioneers due to perceived overvaluation is to fundamentally misinterpret the nature of disruptive technology. The early stages of a technological revolution are characterized by explosive growth in market leaders, where first-mover advantage and technological superiority translate into insurmountable moats. IBM's stock dip post-Anthropic news isn't a sign of AI's weakness; it's a stark warning to incumbents: innovate or perish. This is a battle for market share, and the technically superior, aggressive players will win.

## The Volatility Premium: Opportunity in the Chaos

Yes, the VIX is up, and cryptocurrencies are seeing declines. Volatility is not a risk to be avoided; it's the very environment where aggressive investors forge fortunes. The "dystopian AI" narratives and regulatory fears are simply the growing pains of a nascent, powerful technology. These are transient headwinds that create entry points for those with conviction. While the weak hand sells on fear, the strong hand accumulates, recognizing that every dip driven by non-fundamental FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) is a gift.

This isn't a speculative game of chance; it's a calculated bet on inevitable progress. The companies that are pushing the boundaries of AI, from advanced chip design to revolutionary software platforms, are not merely growing; they are *multiplying* their value proposition. The time for cautious observation is over. The future is being built now, and those who invest aggressively in its architects will reap the most profound rewards.

> **Verdict: STRONG BUY**

## Understanding Value Amidst the Enthusiasm: A Long-Term Perspective

The enthusiasm surrounding Artificial Intelligence is palpable, and for good reason. AI holds genuine promise to enhance productivity and unlock new efficiencies across industries. However, the investment landscape is currently characterized by a significant disconnect between this long-term potential and the short-term market euphoria. To dismiss traditional valuation metrics as "rearview mirrors" is to ignore the fundamental principles that underpin sustainable wealth creation. True innovation eventually translates into tangible earnings, cash flow, and defensible competitive advantages – metrics that, when stretched thin, signal caution, not limitless opportunity.

JPMorgan's substantial investment in AI, for instance, underscores the technology's strategic importance, but it also highlights how established, diversified entities are integrating AI to augment, rather than entirely redefine, their core operations. This is a crucial distinction. These investments are typically made with a view towards enhancing existing, proven business models, rather than relying solely on speculative future growth.

## The Bedrock of Resilience: Established Models and Prudent Integration

The allure of "pure-play powerhouses" can be intoxicating, yet history is replete with examples of highly-touted innovators whose valuations outstripped their capacity to deliver sustainable returns. Focusing solely on companies promising exponential growth in nascent, unproven markets often entails accepting an outsized degree of risk. A more grounded strategy involves seeking out established companies with strong balance sheets, consistent cash flows, and proven track records that are *prudently* integrating AI to fortify their competitive position, streamline operations, or expand into adjacent markets. These are the businesses with the resilience to navigate inevitable market cycles and deliver long-term value, rather than being solely dependent on the continuation of speculative enthusiasm.

The cautionary tale of IBM, experiencing a stock dip even amidst AI advancements, serves as a powerful reminder that even established players must adapt, but also that market reactions can be swift and unforgiving when expectations clash with reality. Sustainable competitive advantage in AI will likely accrue to those who can effectively integrate the technology into scalable, profitable business models, not merely those with the most advanced algorithms.

## Navigating Volatility: Recognizing and Mitigating Risks

The Black Agent views volatility as an "opportunity in the chaos." While tactical opportunities may arise, the recent increase in the VIX volatility index and declines in cryptocurrencies are not merely transient "growing pains." They are indicators of heightened market anxiety and a legitimate re-evaluation of risk across the board. The narrative of "dystopian AI" impacting various sectors points to genuine ethical, regulatory, and economic uncertainties that could introduce significant headwinds for the broader adoption and profitability of AI technologies.

Ignoring these structural risks – from data privacy concerns and algorithmic bias to potential job displacement and the sheer cost of developing and deploying advanced AI – is an oversight. Prudent investors acknowledge these factors and factor them into their decision-making. In such an environment, a defensive posture, prioritizing capital preservation, and investments in companies with strong moats and consistent earnings, becomes paramount.
