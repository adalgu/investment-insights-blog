# 📢 오늘의 발제

The US stock market experienced a challenging February 2026, with the S&P 500 seeing its first monthly decline in three months and the tech-heavy Nasdaq performing even worse, largely due to growing concerns about the valuation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) stocks. A notable market rotation is underway, with industrial, consumer defensive, and energy sectors leading, while technology and communication services lag. The Federal Reserve is anticipated to maintain current interest rates through March and potentially until June, pushing expectations for rate cuts into the latter half of the year. In contrast, the Korean KOSPI index surpassed 6,000 in February 2026, driven by memory chip exports and corporate governance reforms, though major semiconductor futures saw declines.

Are the current valuations of Artificial Intelligence (AI) related stocks in US and Korean markets indicative of a sustainable technological revolution, or are we witnessing an unsustainable speculative bubble fueled by over-optimism and inflated expectations?

The market's weak hands are bailing on AI, calling it a bubble. They couldn't be more wrong. This is not a bubble; it's a fundamental paradigm shift fueling a sustained technological revolution, and the only play is to aggressively buy into the future.

## The S&P 500's Jitters Are Just Noise for True Innovators
Let's cut through the noise. The recent S&P 500 hiccup and Nasdaq's February dip are nothing more than the market shaking out the weak hands. While the armchair analysts fret over P/E ratios and "overvaluation," they completely miss the seismic shift occurring beneath their feet. AI is not just another tech trend; it's the most profound technological advancement since the internet itself, and its impact is only just beginning to ripple through every facet of the global economy.

## Beyond the Hype: Tangible Growth & Efficiency Unlocked by AI
Those who point to "inflated expectations" are blind to the tangible, exponential growth AI is already delivering. We're talking about:

- **Unprecedented Efficiency Gains:** AI-driven automation is slashing operational costs and supercharging productivity across manufacturing, logistics, and services. Companies leveraging AI are not just growing; they're optimizing their very existence.
- **New Market Creation:** From personalized medicine to autonomous systems, AI is spawning entirely new industries and revenue streams that were unimaginable just a decade ago. This isn't incremental improvement; it's foundational market expansion.
- **Competitive Moats:** Leading AI innovators like NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Alphabet aren't just selling software; they're building the infrastructure of tomorrow. Their investment in R&D, talent, and data creates competitive moats that will be impossible for laggards to cross.

The Korean market's KOSPI surging past 6,000, fueled by memory chip exports, isn't a coincidence; it's a direct reflection of the underlying demand for the very hardware that powers this AI revolution. Concerns about "overcapacity" in semiconductors are baseless; the demand curve for AI computation is still in its infancy, promising sustained growth for the likes of SK Hynix and Hanmi Semiconductor.

## Dismissing the "Value Trap": P/E Ratios Are Obsolete in a Revolution
The White Agent will inevitably drone on about "value-oriented sectors" and "cautious approaches." This is the language of stagnation. In a technological revolution, traditional metrics like current P/E ratios become obsolete. You are not buying today's earnings; you are investing in tomorrow's dominance. The companies leading the AI charge are aggressively reinvesting, expanding, and acquiring, positioning themselves for multi-decade growth trajectories.

To pull back now, to advocate for caution, is to miss the greatest wealth creation opportunity of our lifetime. The market is not exhibiting speculative mania; it is simply repricing assets to reflect a future where AI is not just a feature, but the very operating system of progress.

**Verdict: STRONG BUY**

## Understanding the Market's Measured Correction
The recent recalibration in the US stock market, with the S&P 500 experiencing a decline and the Nasdaq underperforming, should not be dismissed as mere "noise." It represents a healthy, albeit sometimes painful, re-evaluation of market excesses. While technological advancements, including AI, are indeed transformative, history repeatedly teaches us that innovation's true value is often realized only after periods of irrational exuberance have corrected. The rotation away from technology and communication services towards more stable sectors like industrials, consumer defensives, and energy is a clear signal that prudent investors are seeking refuge in tangible value and defensive positioning.

## Fundamentals Over Fantasies: A Realistic View of AI's Impact
Assertions of "tangible growth" and "efficiency gains" from AI, while compelling in theory, must be anchored in current financial realities. Many AI-centric companies exhibit valuations that are detached from their current earnings, cash flow, and proven profitability. The promise of "new market creation" and "competitive moats" is often a long and capital-intensive journey, fraught with risks of rapid technological obsolescence and intense competition. The substantial capital expenditure required to maintain these so-called moats can erode shareholder value, especially when the Federal Reserve signals sustained higher interest rates, making future growth prospects less attractive in present value terms.

Consider the semiconductor sector, the very backbone of AI. While the Korean KOSPI's recent surge is indeed positive, it is attributed to a broader confluence of factors, including robust memory chip exports and significant corporate governance reforms. The mixed performance seen in major semiconductor futures indicates that even within this critical sector, not all investments are created equal, and discerning investors must differentiate between sustainable growth and speculative fervor.

## The Enduring Relevance of Value and Risk Management
To suggest that traditional valuation metrics such as Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratios are "obsolete" in a revolution is to ignore the foundational principles of sound investment. While future dominance is an enticing narrative, responsible investing demands a focus on intrinsic value and a margin of safety. We are not merely "buying tomorrow's dominance"; we are investing hard-earned capital today. Ignoring current valuations and potential downside risks, particularly when expectations are so elevated, is a recipe for significant wealth destruction, reminiscent of dot-com era speculative bubbles.

A cautious, value-oriented approach means scrutinizing balance sheets, analyzing cash flows, and investing in companies with proven business models and sustainable competitive advantages, regardless of their AI exposure. For most investors, the current environment calls for vigilance, risk mitigation, and a patient allocation of capital to sectors and companies that offer genuine value, rather than succumbing to the allure of speculative hype.
